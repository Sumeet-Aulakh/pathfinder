Hiring Committee<br/>
Affirm<br/>
Winnipeg, MB<br/>

I am excited to apply for the Software Engineer II (Account Management) position at Affirm. With over 1.5 years of experience in software engineering, I have honed my skills in Python and Kotlin, successfully designing and launching backend systems that enhance user engagement and operational efficiency. My recent project, Project Genisys, utilized Python to develop an AI-driven backend system, resulting in a 50% increase in user interactions.

My proficiency with AWS, MySQL, and Kubernetes aligns well with the technical requirements of this role. I have a proven track record of writing clear, well-tested code and engaging in thorough code reviews, contributing to a collaborative team environment. Additionally, my experience as a Full Stack Developer has equipped me with the ability to break down complex projects into manageable tasks while collaborating effectively with product management and design teams.

I am eager to bring my background in technology and finance, along with my commitment to personal growth and feedback, to the innovative team at Affirm. Thank you for considering my application.

Warm Regards,<br/>
