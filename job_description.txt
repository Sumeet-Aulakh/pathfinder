Full-Time Permanent Position



The Future of AEC Isn't About Buying SoftwareIt's About Building It.



For too long, the AEC industry has been constrained by monolithic, one-size-fits-all software. This "kitchen-sink" model stifles innovation and locks firms into black-box solutions.

At JMT Consultants, we are a Global Structural Consulting Firm, renowned for innovation and precision and we believe this paradigm is broken.



We see a fundamental shift happening a move toward a more open, connected, and customized digital future. Instead of being passive consumers, we are becoming active creators of our own technology, building lightweight, powerful applications that perfectly match our unique project delivery workflows.



We have already started this journey and we're looking for a skilled Full-Stack Developer to be a driving force in this transformation, building powerful, integrated, multi-platform tools that give us a decisive edge.



Are you ready to stop just using the tools and start building the future?

What youll do:



Build & Implement: Design, develop, and deploy key backend and frontend components of our next-generation AEC platform, seamlessly integrating desktop and web technologies
Own the Data Pipeline: Implement and manage robust data workflows using modern data exchange platforms and open APIs to ensure seamless interoperability between our diverse design applications
Create Powerful Visualizations: Develop high-performance, web-based 3D/BIM data visualization and manipulation features, bringing complex project data to life in the browser
Integrate Intelligence: Develop and integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) models to create powerful, predictive, and automated workflows
Collaborate for Impact: Work directly with our engineers and detailers to understand their unique challenges and build the exact solutions they need to excel


What Were Looking for:



3-5+ years of professional experience as a full-stack developer with proficiency in C#, the .NET Framework (WPF, ASP.NET), and SQL
Proven experience building and maintaining web applications with modern frameworks like Angular and TypeScript
Experience with cloud platforms (Microsoft Azure) and CI/CD processes, particularly using Azure DevOps for managing source control, pipelines, and deployments
A genuine interest in, and ideally some experience with, AEC-specific platforms, open-source 3D/BIM libraries, or applied AI
You are a strong independent contributor who also thrives in a collaborative team environment
A track record of shipping software and owning features from conception to deployment


Why Start a Career with Us?



Be a Pioneer: This isn't a typical software development role. You will be at the forefront of a movement, fundamentally changing how an established AEC firm operates.

Direct Impact: Your work will directly empower our teams, improve project outcomes, and give our companies a significant competitive edge.

Innovation Culture: Join a team that rejects the status quo and is actively investing in an open, modern, and intelligent tech stack.

Career Growth: This is a chance to become a leader in the growing field of AEC technology and software development from within the industry.

Exciting Times Ahead: We are on the cusp of some major developments. You'll be joining at the perfect time to contribute to and be a part of these exciting announcements.



If you are a developer who wants to build more than just another application if you want to build the future of an entire industry we encourage you to apply.



Must Haves:



A bachelor's degree or a combination of proven skills and experience will be considered.
Canadian Citizenship/Legally able to work in Canada
